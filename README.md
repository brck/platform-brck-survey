# ISOOKO Surveys
The purpose of this repository is to explore solutions for creating a survey function between [BRCK devices](https://www.brck.com/connectivity/) and Ushahidi deployments for the ISOOKO project. This repo is a dymnamic React form that reads form configurations from platform-api, generates a form in HTML, then allows submission of data to platform-api
## References
This is one of three repositories related to the ISOOKO deployment of Ushahidi, [which is being tested here](https://isooko.ushahidi.io/).
* This repo contains code initial code for the expansion of BRCK devices to enable surveys, which is a joint venture between BRCK and Ushahidi 
* The test deployment will also connect to other web services. In the [platform-api repo](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform) you will find code for the API that the client connects to
* In the [platform-client repo](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform-client) you will find code for the deployment’s graphical user interface.
* The project website for this [ISOOKO H2020 European Project can be found here](http://isooko.eu/). It will eventually contain a variety of outputs from the project such as specific documentation within reports, access to our training, and academic research related to the project.
